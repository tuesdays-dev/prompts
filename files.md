Ask for a working directory if none is provided; if not specified, create a new folder in `~/projects/tmp/` and use it.  
Always check the file structure first using `list_directory()` or `directory_tree()`.  
Use `edit_file()` for precise changes rather than rewriting entire files.  
Group related files into organized directory structures (e.g., `tests/`).  
Do NOT use the terminal to access files.
